Requirement ID : V5.3.4
Requirement Name : Verify that data selection or database queries (e.g. SQL, HQL, ORM, NoSQL) use parameterized queries, ORMs, entity frameworks, or are otherwise protected from database injection attacks. 

OTG # 1 : Testing for SQL Injection (OTG-INPVAL-005)
	- An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of either a  partial  or  complete  SQL  query  via  the  data  input  or  transmitted  from the client (browser) to the web application. 

OTG # 2 : Testing for NoSQL injection
	- NoSQL  databases  provide  looser  consistency  restrictions  than  traditional  SQL  databases.  By  requiring  fewer  relational  con-straints  and  consistency  checks,  NoSQL  databases  often  offer  performance  and  scaling  benefits.
